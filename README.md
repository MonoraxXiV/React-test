#React test

This repository is my first React project.
It's made by following this tutorial:  https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html  
Following the local Development environment path.

The goal of this exercise is to make a game of tictactoe and to get a better understanding of how react works as well as the syntax of React.
